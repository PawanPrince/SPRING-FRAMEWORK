SPRING FRAMEWORK:

What is Spring FrameWork?
It is an open source light weight framework for building a java application, It is created on the top of JEE to simplify the java development
and providing a more flexiable and testable approch to building java application, It is used to achive the microServices design pattern so the
programmer can support the product in easy way.

Why we use Spring FrameWork?
We use spring framework to simplify java development and overcome with the disadvantages JEE.
Spring framework providing multiple modules where we can achive easy development such as: 
                                          1) Dependency Injection (DI) and  Inversion of Control (IOC)

                                          2)Modular and Light weight 
																						  
A programmer wants to use some specific programs such as Spring MVC , Spring Core, Spring Data.

Unlike JEE Spring is not a heavy weight 
                                          3) Aspect oriented programming
										  
this is used to seperate cross cutting conserns like as login framework, security features and transaction management system from business logic

                                          4) SPRING MVC :
										  
it is a powerful and customizable web frame wor for building RESTfullAPIS and web Apps by forming a concept of model view  controller 

                                          5) SPRING BOOT: 
										  
It is a prt of spring eco System that simplifies the development of Java application with the help of auto configration, embedded server 
and production ready features.

                                          6) Integration with other tecnologies: 
										  
we can integrate our java application with other tecnologies such as hibernate, JPA, APACHE KAFKA, RabbitMQ, Doker and DAtaBases

Testing Support: It provides built-in Supports for testing components for using Junit and MoKito

                                                      CORE MODULES OF SPRINF FRAMEWORKS
													  ----------------------------------
					1) SPring CORE : it provides DI and IOC controller.
					2) Spring BOOT : it simplifies application configration and deplymnt
					3) Spring DATA JPA : it simplifies data acciciblities from any rdbms and NoSQL databases
					4) Spring MVC : which is used to create web application 
					5) Spring Security : provide a security features
